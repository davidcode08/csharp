# My knowledge and experience in using C#.

The shoppingcart project is a basic command-line style project, where it allows many customer shopping interactions.

The webform-shoppingcart is another cart-related project, but written using Microsoft ASP.NET WebForm.

PLEASE view the detail readme.txt files inside the folders for further information.
