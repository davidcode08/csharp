/Description

The Products details (ID, Name, Stock, Price, etc) are stored in the ProductInventory.txt in the /bin/Debug folder. Every changes after the user checkout will be updated to this file, which in turn updates the store display also.

The console application provides 5 basic interactions: add an item to cart, remove an item from the cart, view the cart, checkout and pay, exit.

Display formatting, Input validation and exception handling is properly implemented.

Note: Please download the folder and run on your computer using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or equivalent versions.
